# TODO List: Standout Blind XSS Server Project

## I. Core Infrastructure & Baseline Features
- [ ] **Setup Basic Callback Server:**
    - [ ] HTTP/S listener for incoming XSS payloads.
    - [ ] Secure data storage for collected information (consider encryption at rest).
- [ ] **Develop Basic Payload Generation:**
    - [ ] Generate simple JavaScript payloads that collect essential data.
    - [ ] Offer easy-to-copy payload snippets.
- [ ] **Implement Core Data Collection:**
    - [ ] Victim IP Address, User-Agent.
    - [ ] Full URI of the page where XSS fired.
    - [ ] Referer header.
    - [ ] Non-HTTPOnly Cookies.
    - [ ] Basic DOM content (`document.documentElement.outerHTML`).
    - [ ] Screenshot of the page (using HTML5 canvas like `html2canvas` or `html-to-image`).
    - [ ] Local Storage and Session Storage content.
- [ ] **Build a Web UI/Dashboard:**
    - [ ] Display collected XSS reports.
    - [ ] Allow viewing of individual report details.
    - [ ] Basic filtering/searching of reports.
- [ ] **Basic Notification System:**
    - [ ] Email notifications for new XSS fires.

## II. Advanced Data Exfiltration (Focus on Standout Features)
*Many advanced techniques require robust PoCs. Further research and testing will be critical here.*
- [ ] **Enhanced DOM Snapshots:**
    - [ ] Investigate libraries like `simpleneeraj/capture-dom` to serialize DOM with computed styles, potentially to SVG or a replayable format (beyond just a flat image).
    - [ ] *Further Research: Robustly capture and reconstruct the full live DOM state including all CSS rules.*
- [ ] **Detailed Browser Fingerprinting:**
    - [ ] Integrate a library like FingerprintJS (open-source version) or ThumbmarkJS.
    - [ ] Capture detailed attributes (canvas, fonts, WebGL, audio profiles, screen details, timezone, language, etc.).
    - [ ] *Further Research: Obtain a definitive list of data points collected by the chosen open-source fingerprinting library and ensure robust collection.*
- [ ] **Browser Extension Information (Opportunistic):**
    - [ ] Implement probing for `web_accessible_resources` of common/interesting extensions.
    - [ ] *Further Research: Develop safe and reliable PoCs for detecting specific extensions. Note: Interacting with or exfiltrating data *from* extensions requires targeting vulnerable extensions and is highly complex and ethically sensitive.*
- [ ] **Service Worker Exploitation for Persistence & Exfiltration:**
    - [ ] Develop payloads capable of registering a malicious Service Worker.
    - [ ] Implement Service Worker logic to:
        - [ ] Intercept future fetch requests for data exfiltration.
        - [ ] Utilize Background Sync for covert exfiltration.
        - [ ] Achieve persistence of the XSS.
    - [ ] *Further Research: Find/develop reliable PoCs for XSS-initiated Service Worker registration and data exfiltration strategies, addressing scope limitations and SW lifecycle.*
- [ ] **HTML Smuggling for Data Exfiltration:**
    - [ ] Craft payloads that package exfiltrated data into a Blob client-side.
    - [ ] Implement logic to send the Blob's *content* via XHR/fetch to your server (avoiding forced downloads).
- [ ] **Alternative OOB Channels (Requires significant research/testing):**
    - [ ] **DNS Exfiltration:**
        - [ ] Develop client-side JavaScript to encode data into subdomains and trigger DNS lookups (e.g., via image sources, script sources, or fetch to a controlled subdomain).
        - [ ] *Further Research: Find/create robust JS snippets for DNS exfil, handling chunking and encoding.*
    - [ ] **WebRTC Data Channels:**
        - [ ] Explore using WebRTC data channels for covert OOB communication.
        - [ ] *Further Research: Tackle the signaling server requirement – can it be simplified or proxied for XSS payloads? Look for PoCs.*

## III. Reporting & Notifications (Innovative & Customizable)
- [ ] **Real-time Alerts & Diverse Channels:**
    - [ ] Ensure notifications are as close to real-time as possible.
    - [ ] **Standard Channels:** Email, Webhooks (highly customizable), Slack, Telegram.
    - [ ] **Secure Channels:**
        - [ ] PGP-encrypted email notifications (integrate libraries like `nodemailer-openpgp` for Node.js or `python-gnupg` for Python).
        - [ ] *Further Research: Feasibility of direct integration with Signal or Matrix (may require unofficial APIs or bridge services – assess reliability and security).*
- [ ] **Advanced Report Filtering & Tagging:**
    - [ ] Allow users to add custom tags to XSS reports (e.g., `project:xyz`, `critical`, `admin-panel`).
    - [ ] Implement advanced filtering based on all collected data fields and custom tags (e.g., `victim_ip_starts_with: "10." AND tag: "critical"`).
    - [ ] Support complex query operators (equals, contains, starts/ends with, regex).
- [ ] **Event Correlation Engine:**
    - [ ] Develop logic to correlate multiple XSS events:
        - [ ] From the same victim (IP, User-Agent, session identifiers if available).
        - [ ] Indicating an attack chain (e.g., XSS fire -> successful page grab -> subsequent XSS on a new page).
        - [ ] Grouping similar vulnerabilities (e.g., same vulnerable parameter across different pages).
    - [ ] *Further Research: Define specific correlation rules and logic tailored to Blind XSS scenarios.*
- [ ] **Interactive Dashboards & Visualizations:**
    - [ ] Utilize JS charting libraries (e.g., D3.js, ECharts, Chart.js, Highcharts).
    - [ ] **Standard Visualizations:**
        - [ ] Timeline of XSS events.
        - [ ] Geographic map of victim IPs (with appropriate privacy considerations/anonymization).
        - [ ] Pie/Bar charts of top vulnerable pages, parameters, browsers, OS.
    - [ ] **Innovative Visualizations:**
        - [ ] Sankey diagrams or graph visualizations for attack paths or data exfiltration flows.
        - [ ] Heatmaps for activity.
        - [ ] *Further Research: Explore novel ways to visualize XSS data to provide deeper insights.*

## IV. Payload Management & Delivery (Sophistication & Evasion)
- [ ] **Payload Templating & Dynamic Generation:**
    - [ ] Allow users to create payload templates.
    - [ ] Dynamically generate payloads based on selected features or target context.
- [ ] **Built-in Obfuscation & Evasion Techniques:**
    - [ ] Offer multiple layers/types of JavaScript obfuscation.
    - [ ] Include techniques to bypass common WAF signatures or input filters.
    - [ ] *Further Research: Stay updated on latest WAF evasion techniques.*
- [ ] **Payload Versioning & Management:**
    - [ ] Allow users to save, categorize, and version their custom payloads.
- [ ] **Short/Stealthy Payload Delivery Options:**
    - [ ] Provide shortened URLs for payloads.
    - [ ] Offer payloads that are less likely to be detected by simple pattern matching.

## V. Server Security, Usability & Stealth
- [ ] **Enhanced Server Security:**
    - [ ] Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for accessing the server UI.
    - [ ] Ensure all dependencies are regularly updated and audited.
    - [ ] Harden server configuration (HTTP headers, TLS settings).
    - [ ] Encrypt sensitive configuration data and stored XSS findings at rest.
- [ ] **Improved Usability:**
    - [ ] Clean, intuitive, and responsive web UI.
    - [ ] Easy deployment options (e.g., Docker container, detailed setup scripts).
    - [ ] Develop a well-documented API for programmatic interaction.
    - [ ] Consider multi-user support with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) if intended for team use.
- [ ] **Server-Side Stealth:**
    - [ ] Allow customization of server response headers to avoid easy fingerprinting.
    - [ ] Advise users on using non-obvious domain names for the callback server.
    - [ ] *Further Research: Techniques for blending XSS callback traffic with legitimate-looking traffic.*
- [ ] **Payload Stealth (Client-Side):**
    - [ ] Anti-debugging techniques in payloads.
    - [ ] Delayed execution or conditional triggering (see Context-Aware Triggering).
    - [ ] Techniques to avoid detection by client-side security tools.

## VI. Context-Aware Triggering (Intelligent Payloads)
- [ ] **Develop Payloads That Assess Environment:**
    - [ ] Check for specific cookies, localStorage items, or JavaScript variables.
    - [ ] Identify if running in a privileged context (e.g., admin section based on DOM elements).
    - [ ] Detect if developer tools are open.
- [ ] **Implement Conditional Logic:**
    - [ ] Only exfiltrate sensitive data if certain conditions are met.
    - [ ] Trigger more aggressive payloads only in specific contexts.
    - [ ] Delayed payload execution.

## VII. General Project & Research Notes
- [ ] **Address Research Gaps:** Due to inaccessible resources during the initial research, some advanced techniques require deeper investigation and PoC development. Prioritize areas that offer the most "standout" potential.
- [ ] **Ethical Considerations:** Always use such a tool responsibly and legally. Clearly define the ethical use cases for your project.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Thoroughly document the server setup, features, payload creation, and API usage.
- [ ] **Community & Updates:** Consider how the project will be maintained and updated with new XSS techniques and browser changes.

Good luck with your project! This list should provide a solid roadmap.
