    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-yellow-400">
      I'm Ricardo Ferreira, a cybersecurity student with a strong interest in offensive security and ethical hacking.
      I created <strong>BlindHook</strong> to serve as a blind XSS payload collector, a tool that can help identify and monitor
      client-side execution of malicious scripts in environments where traditional feedback mechanisms fail.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-yellow-400">
      This platform allows me to capture metadata from triggered payloads, such as the victim's IP address, user-agent, visited URL,
      and a screenshot of the page at execution time. The collected data is then presented in a dashboard.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-yellow-400">
      I'm passionate about web application security, bug bounty hunting, and red teaming. I built this tool to support
      stealthy payload testing during internal assessments or CTF-style exercises. My focus is on creating practical, real-world tools
      that help visualize how and when payloads fire.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm mt-8 text-yellow-500 italic">
      BlindHook is intended strictly for ethical and authorized security research. Unauthorized use is prohibited.
